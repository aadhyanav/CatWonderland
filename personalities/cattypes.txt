        Your owner is out the whole day on a day trip. How do you decide to spend the whole day?
        Sit at the door, meow, and wait for them while sulking all day :(
        Oh no!! Your owner returns with a new cat! How do you react?
        Yay!! I’ve been so lonely. I’m excited to have a new friend! :)
        Hmph! This new cat decides to take your favorite spot on the cat tree! You…
        Decide to join them and cuddle!
        Your owner feels bad and gives you treats to make you feel better. You decide to…
        I feel bad that the new cat doesn't get any. Let save a treat for them!
        Eh? The front door is suddenly open. The outside world! You… 
        It looks fun! But scary. Try to convince the new cat to go outside with you. 
        You hear the sound of the food container. It’s dinner time! You…
        I’ll wait! It will come to me all the same. 
        It's time to go to bed! The moon is out. You...
        Cuddle with my owner, they look exhausted.
