        Your owner is out the whole day on a day trip. How do you decide to spend the whole day?
        Sit at the door, meow, and wait for them while sulking all day :(
        Oh no!! Your owner returns with a new cat! How do you react?
        Yay!! I’ve been so lonely. I’m excited to have a new friend! :)
        Hmph! This new cat decides to take your favorite spot on the cat tree! You…
        Decide to join them and cuddle!
        Your owner feels bad and gives you treats to make you feel better. You decide to…
        I feel bad that the new cat doesn't get any. Let save a treat for them!
        Eh? The front door is suddenly open. The outside world! You… 
        It looks fun! But scary. Try to convince the new cat to go outside with you. 
        You hear the sound of the food container. It’s dinner time! You…
        I’ll wait! It will come to me all the same. 
        It's time to go to bed! The moon is out. You..
        Cuddle with my owner, they look exhausted.

       Who cares? I get to sleep all day! 
       Oh no!! Your owner returns with a new cat! How do you react?
       Who the heck is this?! I’m not sharing my wet food! I’m just going to ignore them.
       Hmph! This new cat decides to take your favorite spot on the cat tree! You…
       Decide to join them and cuddle!
       Your owner feels bad and gives you treats to make you feel better. You decide to…
       Take the offer! Eat the yummy treats with lots of delight.
       Eh? The front door is suddenly open. The outside world! You… 
       Didn’t even notice. Was sleeping the entire time!
       You hear the sound of the food container. It’s dinner time! You…
       It’s that time. I’m already waiting by the bowl and meowing at them to hurry up!
       It's time to go to bed! The moon is out. You..
       Lay down at my favorite spot on the cat tree.

       I wasn’t expecting this, but I'm curious! Who knows what this new cat will be like? 
       Hmph! This new cat decides to take your favorite spot on the cat tree! You…
       Hiss! Make it extremely clear that this is my home and my spot!

       Stay inside. I’m sure this is a lot better than what the outside has to offer.
       You hear the sound of the food container. It’s dinner time! You…
       FOOD! I immediately run over to eat as it’s poured out of the container.
       It's time to go to bed! The moon is out. You..
       Lay down at my favorite spot on the cat tree.
